./hailstone
Enter the starting value: 18
Hailstone sequence: 18, 9, 28, 14, 7, 22, ... , 1
Sequence length: 21

A positive integer, n
If n equals 1, the sequence is over
if n is even, then next value is n/2  - the next value is half
if n is odd, the next value is (n*3)+1 - the next value is 3 times plus one
Eventually this sequence terminate with n==1
