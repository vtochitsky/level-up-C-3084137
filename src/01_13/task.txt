Score a Frame of Bowling

A game is divided into 10 frames
in each frame:
-roll a ball to knock down 10 pins
-all 10 pins down on the first ball is a strike
-score is 10 points plus the next two balls rolled (X)Roll a ball to knock down 10 pins
if you fail to knock down all pins
-for non-strikes, roll a second ball in the frame
-if you knock down the remainder of the pins, you score a spare (/)
-score is 10 points plus the next ball rolled
-score is the sum of the pins knocked down (two balls)
-A score of zero is recorder as a single dash (-)

Here are sme sample frames:
-All 10 pins first frame, strike (X)
-8 pins first frame, 2 pins second frame, spare(/)
-4 pins first frame, 1 pin second frame, total 5
-Zero pins first frame (-), 6 pins second frame, total 6


Before computers took over, bowlers scored their own game. 
Knocked pins were recorded and scores tallied. 
The calculations are basic math and people seemed to enjoy it. 
You can enjoy it too for this C code challenge. 
I'd like you to code a single frame from a game of bowling. <-----
A game is divided into 10 frames. 
In each frame the object is to roll a ball and knock down 10 pins. 
If you roll the ball and it knocks down all 10 pins, that's a strike. 
The symbol being an X. 
Your score is 10 points plus the points for the next two balls. 
If you fail to knock down all 10 pins, you roll a second ball in the frame. 
If you knock down the remainder of the pins, you score a spare. 
The symbol being a slash or half an X. 
The score is 10 points plus the points of the next ball. 
If you don't get down all 10 pins, your score is the sum of all the pins knocked over by the two balls. 
A score of zero or a gutter ball is denoted by a dash. 
Here are some sample frames, a strike, a spare, and something more typical of my bowling game. 
This is the output you must generate for this challenge: simulate a single frame in a game of bowling. <-----
